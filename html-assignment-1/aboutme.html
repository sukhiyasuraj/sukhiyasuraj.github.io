                I am also a human name Suraj Sukhiya From West part of India, let me Start from Being Honest I never wanted
                to do studies like every other child but somehow, I was always fascinated about Technology around me, always
                like to try
                out tings and do experiments and learn about them so Computers Became my Primary source of Entertainment and
                Focus for rest of my life. Apart from This Since Childhood I Started knowing the things about after life and
                spirituality
                which is everything in my life now.

                When I was 10, I stated going on this path which has helped me significantly at each and every point in our
                life I guess not just that I love traveling and Filming a lot. I can Proudly say that I have Seen 80% of
                India through my
                own eyes and know about 4-5 different Indian languages and Culture, also since last year I started making
                vlogs so that I can make my memories and share my journey with other people. And thatâ€™s my Dream too, travel
                as much as possible
                and be a good content creator and be stress free and successful. Success without hurting someone (Karma is
                Watching) so when the time comes, we can leave Happily.
