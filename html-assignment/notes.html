        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>

        <dl>
            <dt>!DOCTYPE Tag</dt>
            <dd>All HTML documents must start with a
                <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

                The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to
                expect.

                In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:
            </dd>
            <dt>Anchor Tag</dt>
            <dd>The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

                    The most important attribute of the element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's
                        destination.

                        By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
                        <ul>
                            <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
                            <li> A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
                            <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
                        </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>List/li Tag</dt>
            <dd>
                The li tag defines a list item.

                The li tag is used inside ordered lists(li), unordered lists (ul), and in menu lists (menu).
                In ul and menu, the list items will usually be displayed with bullet points.
                In ol, the list items will usually be displayed with numbers or letters
            </dd>
            <dt>Main Tag</dt>
            <dd>The element is used to denote the content of a webpage that relates to the central topic of that page or
                application. It should include content that is unique to that page and should not include content that
                is duplicated across multiple webpages, such as headers, footers, and primary navigation elements.
            </dd>
            </dd>
            <dt>Footer Tag</dt>
            <dd>
                The footer element is a structural element used to identify the footer of a page, document, article, or
                section. A footer typically contains copyright and authorship information or navigational elements
                pertaining to the contents of the parent element.
