                <p>
                    I am also a human name Suraj Sukhiya From West part of India, let me Start from Being Honest I never
                    wanted
                    to do studies like every other child but somehow, I was always fascinated about Technology around
                    me, always
                    like to try
                    out tings and do experiments and learn about them so Computers Became my Primary source of
                    Entertainment and
                    Focus for rest of my life. Apart from This Since Childhood I Started knowing the things about after
                    life and
                    spirituality
                    which is everything in my life now.

                    When I was 10, I stated going on this path which has helped me significantly at each and every point
                    in our
                    life I guess not just that I love traveling and Filming a lot. I can Proudly say that I have Seen
                    80% of
                    India through my
                    own eyes and know about 4-5 different Indian languages and Culture, also since last year I started
                    making
                    vlogs so that I can make my memories and share my journey with other people. And thatâ€™s my Dream
                    too, travel
                    as much as possible
                    and be a good content creator and be stress free and successful. Success without hurting someone
                    (Karma is
                    Watching) so when the time comes, we can leave Happily.
